# 🦠 Plague — On-Chain Social Deduction

> *Can you find Patient Zero before the infection spreads?*

Plague is a fully decentralised, zero-knowledge social deduction game built on **Stellar/Soroban** smart contracts. Players stake XLM to join a room. One player is secretly assigned as **Patient Zero** via verifiable randomness. Each round, Patient Zero silently infects others. Infected players unknowingly drain the pot. The town must vote to eliminate suspects before infected players reach majority — or lose everything.

**No server knows who the thief is. No one can cheat the randomness. No one can lie about their role.**

## ✨ What Makes This Different

| Feature | How |
|---|---|
| **Provably fair roles** | Chainlink-style VRF on Stellar assigns Patient Zero — not even the server knows in advance |
| **ZK hidden roles** | Players commit to their role using a Poseidon hash. ZK circuits (Noir) prove claims without revealing the role |
| **Real stakes** | Players stake XLM. Infected players lose stake each round via on-chain drain. Winners auto-paid. |
| **No middleman** | Soroban smart contracts handle all escrow, voting, and payouts |
| **Neobrutalist UI** | Built with Next.js 14, Tailwind, Framer Motion |

## 🎮 Game Loop

```
1. Players join room & stake XLM  →  Funds escrowed in contract
2. VRF assigns Patient Zero        →  Verifiably random, nobody knows ahead of time
3. All players commit their role   →  ZK commitment stored on-chain
4. Round begins
   ├── Infection phase:   Patient Zero silently infects one player
   ├── Discussion phase:  Players discuss openly (off-chain chat)
   ├── Voting phase:      Players vote on-chain to eliminate a suspect
   └── Drain:             Infected players lose stake to pot
5. Win conditions checked
   ├── Clean team wins:   All infected eliminated → clean players split pot
   └── Infected win:      Infected reach majority → infected split pot
6. Auto-payout via contract
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Rust + Soroban CLI (`cargo install --locked soroban-cli`)
- Noir (`noirup`)
- Redis (for backend room caching)
- [Freighter wallet](https://www.freighter.app/) browser extension

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/plague
cd plague

# Install all JS dependencies
npm install

# Copy env files
cp .env.example backend/.env
cp .env.example frontend/.env.local
# Edit both files with your values

# Start frontend + backend in parallel
npm run dev
```

### Running Contracts Locally

```bash
cd contracts

# Build all contracts
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Run tests
cargo test

# Deploy to testnet
soroban contract deploy \
  --wasm target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/plague_game.wasm \
  --source YOUR_SECRET_KEY \
  --network testnet
```

### Compiling ZK Circuits

```bash
cd zk/circuits

# Compile role commitment circuit
nargo compile role_commitment

# Run circuit tests
nargo test

# Generate proving key (requires powers of tau ceremony)
# See docs/zk-setup.md for trusted setup instructions
```
